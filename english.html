            On June 2, 2024, at the Botanical Garden of Sumy State Pedagogical
            University named after A.S. Makarenko, at the request of the
            charitable organization 'Sumy Jewish Fund Hesed Chaim,' members of
            the NGO 'EcoInitiative' conducted an environmental educational tour
            in celebration of International Children's Day. Participants
            included representatives of the Jewish community of Sumy: children
            from the Sunday school; grandmothers, fathers, and mothers from the
            Family Club; and women from the Women's Club.

                In their feedback, they noted: 'We visited the excursion at the
                Botanical Garden of Sumy State Pedagogical University named
                after A.S. Makarenko. Once again, we were convinced that we live
                in a wonderful, picturesque country with beautiful nature and a
                pleasant climate. In a small area, plants from different corners
                of our planet grow peacefully... Nature itself teaches us that
                all nations and all countries of the world should also live in
                peace and harmony.'
